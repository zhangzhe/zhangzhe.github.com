第一次接触最终幻想7是在08年。当时初中毕业，考入重点高中后家里给买了台PS作为奖励。这在当时算是最高奖励了，我们整个大院也就这么一台，于是我们家在一段时间内成为了游戏厅。
当时玩的日文版，找了一本攻略大概叫"最终幻想七10小时攻略"。听题目就知道不会很详细，加上当时语言完全不懂，玩到通关也没有完全弄清楚魔石和limit系统。但这完全不影响我们在游戏中的投入和获得的乐趣。现在还能清楚的记得克劳德最终劈死萨菲罗斯时候我们发自内心的欢呼（后来才知道这招'超究武神霸斩'是可以在斗技场赢得的）。

时隔16年，终于在今年在ps store上购买了正版，并在psv上完美通关。谨以此文，纪念最终幻想陪我度过的童年。

最终幻想7是最终幻想系列游戏中的第七部作品，也是第一部以PlayStation为平台的作品。作为最终幻想死忠，1-10代都已经通关多次，7代是我玩的系列第二款作品，也是心目中最经典的一代。其剧情，魔石系统以及后期的探索及养成游戏都堪称完美。记得当时的宣传说要完美通过需要100小时以上。



There is a materia called Counter (not counter attack or counter magic) but its a blue materia when you pair it with mime. He must have mastered that materia and mime many times over to get that many counter mimes off

How to max out strength quickly with W-Item trick:
You need morph-materia & W-Item-materia.
Go to Nibelheim Reactor. Setup your items according to the video.
Look for Screamer enemies, they come in groups. Morph one, and do the W-Item trick. Enjoy :)

Song in this video is Black Math - Walking at Night. The PC mod is called Final Fantasy VII Remix v.2.5.1. You can get if from Qhimm forums: http://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?top...

Most of these have been known for years, others I have never cared to share.

Obviously, I did not find all of these peculiarities myself.
Some of these were found by Acro or KartSeven and a whole lot of other people. In fact, if you happen to be fluent in French, you can read about hundreds(!) more of these at ff7.fr .ff7.fr .

Also, you are not really supposed to know any of these unless you are at the height of a powerful obsession with Final Fantasy VII. Actually, I'd be interested in learning how many of these were known to you, so tell me if you don't mind.

Note: Cloud's Omnislash is not necessarily the strongest limit in the game. Using Cid's Highwind Limit Break, or Barret's Ungarmax Limit Break, one can deal more damage than Omnislash. However, this takes much more grinding and most gamers can achieve 9999 damage with each Omnislash strike very easily using Cloud's ultimate weapon. So, Omnislash is the Limit I decided to use for this video.

Where can I find (many elixir)?
Ok, elixirs aren't all that easy to get a hold of in FF7 so you'll have to follow a method. Firstly, go to the little Island south of Bone Village where you'll encounter enemies that look like red dragons (their name escapes me right now). Equip the Morph materia onto someone and get morphing - they have around 40,000HP I think and they morph into elixirs. Do this once.

Next, have you got the W-Item materia? If so, are you familiar with the W-Item trick? Equip W-Item onto someone and get into battle, select W-Item and select elixir and then something else, but instead of using the items select cancel. You'll notice that you now have one more elixir than before - keep doing this until you've got 99 elixirs. Hey I know it's a cheap trick but it's Square's fault .
