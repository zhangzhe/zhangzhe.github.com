My name is Gary Zhang(zhangzhe). I live in BeiJing, China.

I am a programmer, right now work for Focus Solutions Inc.

I love my job and believe my work is meaningful for people and is making the world a better place. I love beautiful codes and try my best writing them.

In spare time I like exercise. Basketball is my favorite. I am also crazy about cycling, running and swimming. I took part in marathon three times, triathlons four times, one time 70.3 ironman and lots of other games.

I also like travelling and reading. "A Song of Ice and Fire" is my favorite.

I worked for openTV in 2007( internship), Idapted from 2007 to 2010, Sunrise telecom in 2010.
Right now I am using Ruby On Rails building application Zurich for Focus Solutions Inc .

Visit here to check my apps and codes. Anything unclear please email me at gary.zzhang@gmail.com.

I will share in this blog most of technique things I met, also part of my personal life. Enjoy:)
